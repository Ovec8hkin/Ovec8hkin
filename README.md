### About Me
I am, currently, a graduate student at the University of Washington - Seattle, where I am studying fisheries science. 

I graduated from the University of Miami (FL) with a BSMAS in marine science and computer science in May 2021. While there, I worked primarily on a large-scale data processing routine for near real-time volcanology data, as well as a smaller project related to the dispersement and connectivity of marine larvae in the Gulf of Maine (in collaboration with Woods Hole Oceanagraphic Institute).

I have been programming since 2014 when I started learning basic web development languages. Since then, I have written code in C, Java, Javascript, Julia, R, Python, and Swift. Recently, I have spent most of my time working in R and Python, and I plan on spending more time in Julia in the coming years. 

### Current Projects
- Management Strategy Evaluation for Pacific Herring
- Prince William Sound Pacific Herring Stock Assessment
- Automated InSAR Data Processing Routine
