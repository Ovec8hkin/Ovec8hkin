### About Me
I am, currently, a research technician with the Univeristy of Alaska - Fairbanks College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, where I am collaborating with members of the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center and North Pacific Fisheries Management Council to develop a management strategy evaluation framework for Alaska sablefish.

I recieved an M.S. from the University of Washington in Aqautic and Fisheries Sciences in December 2023. My thesis research concerned the development of a management strategy evaluationt (MSE) framework for Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and integrating a Bayesian age-structured stock assessment model into the MSE simulation framework. While at UW, I also worked with assessment scientists from NOAA Fisheries to perform stock assessments for Shortspine thornyhead on the U.S. West Coast and Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish in the Gulf of Alaska. 

I have been programming since 2014 when I started learning basic web development languages. Since then, I have written code in C, Java, Javascript, Julia, R, Python, and Swift. Recently, I have spent most of my time working in R and Python, and I plan on spending more time in Julia in the coming years. 

### Current Projects
- Management strategy evaluation of Alaska sablefish
- Modern fisheries stock assessment visualizations
